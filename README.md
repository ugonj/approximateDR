# Approximate Douglas-Rachford algorithm for two-sets convex feasibility problems

This repository contains code for the numerical experiments conducted in the paper [@appDR].

In these experiments we apply the approximate Douglas-Rachford algorithm. This is done using an approximate projection (based on the conditional gradient method). See paper for details.
