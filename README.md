# Approximate Douglas-Rachford algorithm for two-sets convex feasibility problems

This repository contains code for the numerical experiments conducted in
the paper (Díaz Millán, Ferreira, and Ugon 2021).

In these experiments we apply the approximate Douglas-Rachford
algorithm. This is done using an approximate projection (based on the
conditional gradient method). See paper for details.
